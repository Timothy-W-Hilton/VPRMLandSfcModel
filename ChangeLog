Changes from version 1.0 to 1.1   18 Dec 2013

	* added Park_Falls dataset
	* added example code for all functions
	* changed the package name from "VPRMModel" to "VPRM".  The name
	VPRMModel reflects an earlier state of the R code where the
	functionality was divided between two packages, VPRMModel and
	VPRMFramework.  I have eliminated VPRMFramework toward the goal of
	having everything in one package, so now VPRMModel is redundant
	(because the "M" in VPRM already abbreviates "model").
